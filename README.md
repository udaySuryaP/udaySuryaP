# Namaste, I'm Uday 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a driven computer science student (B.Tech, College of Engineering and Management Punnapra) with a strong foundation in Java programming and a passion for full-stack development.  Leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I'm building my skills to tackle complex problems and design innovative software solutions.

As a quick learner who thrives in collaborative environments, I actively seek opportunities to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications.  My strong foundation in data structures and algorithms further enhances my problem-solving abilities.

Additionally, I'm a Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, promoting technical learning and development within the student community.
